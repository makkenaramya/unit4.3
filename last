SQL UPDATE
The SQL commands (UPDATE and DELETE) are used to modify the data that is already in the database. The SQL DELETE command uses a WHERE clause.

SQL UPDATE statement is used to change the data of the records held by tables. Which rows is to be update, it is decided by a condition. To specify condition, we use WHERE clause.

The UPDATE statement can be written in following form:

UPDATE table_name SET [column_name1= value1,... column_nameN = valueN] [WHERE condition]  

UPDATE table_name  
SET column_name = expression  
WHERE conditions  

SQL statement:

UPDATE students  
SET User_Name = 'beinghuman'  
WHERE Student_Id = '3' 

Source Table:

Student_Id	FirstName	LastName	User_Name
1	              Ada	   Sharma	   sharmili
2	             Rahul	 Maurya	   sofamous
3	             James	 Walker	    jonny

Student_Id	FirstName	LastName	User_Name
1	            Ada	     Sharma	  sharmili
2	           Rahul	   Maurya	   sofamous
3	           James	   Walker    beinghuman

SQL JOIN
As the name shows, JOIN means to combine something. In case of SQL, JOIN means "to combine two or more tables".

In SQL, JOIN clause is used to combine the records from two or more tables in a database.

Types of SQL JOIN
+INNER JOIN
+LEFT JOIN
+RIGHT JOIN
+FULL JOIN

INNER Join or EQUI Join
This is a simple JOIN in which the result is based on matched data as per the equality condition specified in the SQL query.

SELECT column-name-list FROM 
table-name1 INNER JOIN table-name2 
WHERE table-name1.column-name = table-name2.column-name;

Example of INNER JOIN

ID	NAME
1	abhi
2	adam
3	alex
4	anu

and the class_info table,

ID	Address
1	DELHI
2	MUMBAI
3	CHENNAI
Inner JOIN query will be,

SELECT * from class INNER JOIN class_info where class.id = class_info.id;

The resultset table will look like,

ID	NAME	ID	Address
1	abhi	1	DELHI
2	adam	2	MUMBAI
3	alex	3	CHENNAI

LEFT Outer Join
The left outer join returns a resultset table with the matched data from the two tables and then the remaining rows of the left table and null from the right table's columns.

Syntax for Left Outer Join is,

SELECT column-name-list FROM 
table-name1 LEFT OUTER JOIN table-name2
ON table-name1.column-name = table-name2.column-name;

To specify a condition, we use the ON keyword with Outer Join.

Left outer Join Syntax for Oracle is,

SELECT column-name-list FROM 
table-name1, table-name2 on table-name1.column-name = table-name2.

Example of Left Outer Join
Here is the class table,

ID	NAME
1	abhi
2	adam
3	alex
4	anu
5	ashish
and the class_info table,

ID	Address
1	DELHI
2	MUMBAI
3	CHENNAI
7	NOIDA
8	PANIPAT
SELECT * FROM class LEFT OUTER JOIN class_info ON (class.id = class_info.id);
The resultset table will look like,

ID	NAME	ID	Address
1	abhi	1	DELHI
2	adam	2	MUMBAI
3	alex	3	CHENNAI
4	anu	null	null
5	ashish	null	null

RIGHT Outer Join
The right outer join returns a resultset table with the matched data from the two tables being joined, then the remaining rows of the right table and null for the remaining left table's columns.

Syntax for Right Outer Join is,

SELECT column-name-list FROM 
table-name1 RIGHT OUTER JOIN table-name2 
ON table-name1.column-name = table-name2.column-name;

Right outer Join Syntax for Oracle is,

SELECT column-name-list FROM 
table-name1, table-name2 
ON table-name1.column-name(+) = table-name2.column-name;

Example of Right Outer Join
Once again the class table,

ID	NAME
1	abhi
2	adam
3	alex
4	anu
5	ashish
and the class_info table,

ID	Address
1	DELHI
2	MUMBAI
3	CHENNAI
7	NOIDA
8	PANIPAT

SELECT * FROM class RIGHT OUTER JOIN class_info ON (class.id = class_info.id);
The resultant table will look like,

ID	NAME	ID	Address
1	abhi	1	DELHI
2	adam	2	MUMBAI
3	alex	3	CHENNAI
null	null	7	NOIDA
null	null	8	PANIPAT

Full Outer Join
The full outer join returns a resultset table with the matched data of two table then remaining rows of both left table and then the right table.

Syntax of Full Outer Join is,

SELECT column-name-list FROM 
table-name1 FULL OUTER JOIN table-name2
ON table-name1.column-name = table-name2.column-name;
Example of Full outer join is,

ID	NAME
1	abhi
2	adam
3	alex
4	anu
5	ashish

and the class_info table,

ID	Address
1	DELHI
2	MUMBAI
3	CHENNAI
7	NOIDA
8	PANIPAT
Full Outer Join query will be like,
SELECT * FROM class FULL OUTER JOIN class_info ON (class.id = class_info.id);

The resultset table will look like,

ID	NAME	ID	Address
1	abhi	1	DELHI
2	adam	2	MUMBAI
3	alex	3	CHENNAI
4	anu	null	null
5	ashish	null	null
null	null	7	NOIDA
null	null	8	PANIPAT
